# Charts

The Eremex Controls Library for Avalonia UI includes high-performance `CartesianChart` control that helps you visualize data as a 2D chart. The control supports multiple series Views and an unlimited number of axes. 

The chart's graphics rendering is optimized to display large data. The control provides high performance even when series contain millions of points.

The chart control supports instant display of rapidly changing real-time data. You can use a special data adapter to implement a moving viewport.
